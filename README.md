## ✅ Problems with Explanation

### 1. Two Sum
Given an array and a target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

- **Brute Force:** Check every pair.
- **Better:** Use a Hash Map to store visited elements.
- **Optimal:** Use Hash Map while iterating to find complement.

---

### 2. Sort 0s, 1s, and 2s
Sort the array containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s.

- **Brute Force:** Use sort function.
- **Better:** Use counting approach.
- **Optimal:** Use Dutch National Flag algorithm.

---

### 3. Majority Element (> n/2 times)
Find the element that appears more than n/2 times.

- **Brute Force:** Count every element.
- **Better:** Use a Hash Map.
- **Optimal:** Use Moore’s Voting Algorithm.

---

### 4. Maximum Subarray Sum
Find the contiguous subarray with the maximum sum.

- **Brute Force:** Generate all subarrays.
- **Better:** Precompute subarray sums.
- **Optimal:** Kadane’s Algorithm.

---

### 5. Rearrange Array by Sign
- Rearrange elements so that positives and negatives appear alternately starting with any sign.
- Remaining elements (if any) are appended at the end.

**Optimal**  
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(n)  
- Algorithm: Two-Pointer

---

### 6. Alternate Positive Negative (Start Positive)
- Rearrange elements to alternate signs but always start with a **positive number**.
- Extra positive/negative values are appended at the end **without changing order**.

**Optimal**  
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(n)  
- Algorithm: Two-Pointer

---

### 7. Next Permutation

Generate the next lexicographically greater permutation of an array. If not possible, return the smallest (i.e., sorted) permutation.

**Example:**
- Input: `[2, 1, 5]`
- Output: `[2, 5, 1]`

---

**Better (STL Solution)**  
Uses built-in `next_permutation()` from `<algorithm>`.

- **Time:** O(n)  
- **Space:** O(1)  
- **Algorithm:** STL

---

**Optimal (Custom Logic)**  
Steps:
1. Find the **first decreasing element** from the end: `a[i] < a[i+1]`
2. Find the **just larger element** to the right of `a[i]`
3. **Swap** both and **reverse** the suffix starting at `i+1`

- **Time:** O(n)  
- **Space:** O(1)  
- **Algorithm:** Lexicographical Permutation (Custom)
