## ✅ Problems with Explanation

### 1. Two Sum

**Brute Force**  
- Time: O(n²)  
- Space: O(1)

**Better** (using Hash Map)  
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(n)

**Optimal**  
- Same as Better  
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(n)

---

### 2. Sort 0s, 1s, and 2s

**Brute Force** (using built-in sort)  
- Time: O(n log n)  
- Space: O(1)

**Better** (Counting approach)  
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(1)

**Optimal** (Dutch National Flag Algorithm)  
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(1)

### 3. Majority Element (>n/2 times)

**Brute Force**  
- Time: O(n²)  
- Space: O(1)

**Better** (using Hash Map)  
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(n)

**Optimal** (Moore’s Voting Algorithm)  
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(1)
