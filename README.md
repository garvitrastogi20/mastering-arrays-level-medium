## ✅ Problems with Explanation

### 1. Two Sum
(…same as above…)

---

### 2. Sort 0s, 1s, and 2s
(…same as above…)

---

### 3. Majority Element (>n/2 times)
(…same as above…)

---

### 4. Maximum Subarray Sum
(…same as above…)

---

### 5. Rearrange Array by Sign

- Rearrange elements so that positives and negatives appear alternately starting with any sign.
- Remaining elements (if any) are appended at the end.

**Optimal**  
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(n)  
- Algorithm: Two-Pointer

---

### 6. Alternate Positive Negative (Start Positive)

- Rearrange elements to alternate signs but always start with a **positive number**.
- Extra positive/negative values are appended at the end **without changing order**.

**Optimal**  
- Time: O(n)  
- Space: O(n)  
- Algorithm: Two-Pointer
